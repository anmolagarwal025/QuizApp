# QuizApp
Here I have design an QuizApp using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

In this I have a simple User Interface using HTML & CSS in which When User come to this page they will get a question with options each in center of the page among which user have to choose one option then only they will able to proceed further if they did not choose any option then screen will become RED and it will only proceed further when one option is choosen.
Like wise when user finishes the quiz they will able to see there SCORE which they have got in there Quiz.
Along with SCORE they can also get an RELOAD BUTTON if they did'nt score well and they want to play again then they can RELOAD the quiz.

All the background Design and handleing is done by using JAVASCRIPT.

For simplicity purpose and it's an small project I have done HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT in the same file.

I am adding some IMAGES below of MY quiz..

1 - When USER arrives they able to see there first Question.
